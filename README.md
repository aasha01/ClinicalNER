# Project Name

#### -- Project Status: [In-Progress]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify the Named Entity Recognition in clinical reports. 
I used the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) database for the baseline for disease and symptoms names.
The data used in this project is "n2c2 NLP Research Data Sets".
For UMLS and n2c2 dataset, we need proper license from the respective sites.
